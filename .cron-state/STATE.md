# GitSight Autoship State

**Branch**: `feature/autoship` (off `origin/main` — never merge, never PR)
**Identity**: Cake (cron) — `51058514+Sanjays2402@users.noreply.github.com`
**Quality gates**: `npm run lint` + `npm run compile` (both = `tsc -p ./ --noEmit` and `tsc -p ./`)
**No emoji in git/code chrome. Monochrome glyphs only.**

## Studied (1st tick, 2026-06-19)

- VS Code extension, TS, strict mode, no test runner installed.
- 19 source files across `git/`, `views/`, `webviews/`, `blame/`, `ai/`.
- `Git` class wraps `git` CLI via `execFile` with `raw()` escape hatch.
- `RepoManager` tracks repos + emits `onDidChange` on `.git/{HEAD,refs,...}` changes.
- 13 tree views + status-bar items (StatusBar, CommitSparkline, WorktreePill).
- AI via Copilot (`vscode.lm`). `ai/commitMessage.ts`, `ai/changelog.ts`, `ai/review.ts`.
- Host detection in `git/hostDetect.ts`: GitHub / Azure DevOps / GitLab / Bitbucket.
- `package.json` 866 lines, 70+ commands, three keybindings, configurable.

## Pattern notes (learned shipping ticks 1-2)

- Pure helpers belong in `src/git/<name>.ts`; UI/wiring goes in `src/views/`.
- Add every new pure helper to `tsconfig.test.json` `include` so tests compile.
- Tests live under `test/git/` with the same filename. Use `node:test`.
- New CodeLens providers should skip files handled by other lenses (avoid clash).
- `git check-ignore --stdin` is the only safe way to attribute huge `node_modules`.
- VS Code status-bar pills hide themselves when their config is off OR when
  there's nothing to show and `hideWhenClean`-style config is true.
